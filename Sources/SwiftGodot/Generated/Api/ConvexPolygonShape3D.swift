/// A 3D convex polyhedron shape used for physics collision.
/// 
/// A 3D convex polyhedron shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a ``CollisionShape3D``.
/// 
/// ``ConvexPolygonShape3D`` is _solid_, which means it detects collisions from objects that are fully inside it, unlike ``ConcavePolygonShape3D`` which is hollow. This makes it more suitable for both detection and physics.
/// 
/// **Convex decomposition:** A concave polyhedron can be split up into several convex polyhedra. This allows dynamic physics bodies to have complex concave collisions (at a performance cost) and can be achieved by using several ``ConvexPolygonShape3D`` nodes. To generate a convex decomposition from a mesh, select the ``MeshInstance3D`` node, go to the **Mesh** menu that appears above the viewport, and choose **Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings**. Alternatively, ``MeshInstance3D/createMultipleConvexCollisions(settings:)`` can be called in a script to perform this decomposition at run-time.
/// 
/// **Performance:** ``ConvexPolygonShape3D`` is faster to check collisions against compared to ``ConcavePolygonShape3D``, but it is slower than primitive collision shapes such as ``SphereShape3D`` and ``BoxShape3D``. Its use should generally be limited to medium-sized objects that cannot have their collision accurately represented by primitive shapes.
