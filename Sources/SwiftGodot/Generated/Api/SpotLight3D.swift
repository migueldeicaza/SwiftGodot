/// A spotlight, such as a reflector spotlight or a lantern.
/// 
/// A Spotlight is a type of ``Light3D`` node that emits lights in a specific direction, in the shape of a cone. The light is attenuated through the distance. This attenuation can be configured by changing the energy, radius and attenuation parameters of ``Light3D``.
/// 
/// > Note: When using the Mobile rendering method, only 8 spot lights can be displayed on each mesh resource. Attempting to display more than 8 spot lights on a single mesh resource will result in spot lights flickering in and out as the camera moves. When using the Compatibility rendering method, only 8 spot lights can be displayed on each mesh resource by default, but this can be increased by adjusting ``ProjectSettings/rendering/limits/opengl/maxLightsPerObject``.
/// 
/// > Note: When using the Mobile or Compatibility rendering methods, spot lights will only correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the light's AABB. If using a shader to deform the mesh in a way that makes it go outside its AABB, ``GeometryInstance3D/extraCullMargin`` must be increased on the mesh. Otherwise, the light may not be visible on the mesh.

    /// 
    /// > Note: Setting attenuation to `2.0` or higher may result in distant objects receiving minimal light, even within range. For example, with a range of `4096`, an object at `100` units is attenuated by a factor of `0.0001`. With a default brightness of `1`, the light would not be visible at that distance.
