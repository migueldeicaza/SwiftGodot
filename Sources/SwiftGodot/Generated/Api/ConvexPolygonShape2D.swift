/// A 2D convex polygon shape used for physics collision.
/// 
/// A 2D convex polygon shape, intended for use in physics. Used internally in ``CollisionPolygon2D`` when it's in ``CollisionPolygon2D/BuildMode/solids`` mode.
/// 
/// ``ConvexPolygonShape2D`` is _solid_, which means it detects collisions from objects that are fully inside it, unlike ``ConcavePolygonShape2D`` which is hollow. This makes it more suitable for both detection and physics.
/// 
/// **Convex decomposition:** A concave polygon can be split up into several convex polygons. This allows dynamic physics bodies to have complex concave collisions (at a performance cost) and can be achieved by using several ``ConvexPolygonShape2D`` nodes or by using the ``CollisionPolygon2D`` node in ``CollisionPolygon2D/BuildMode/solids`` mode. To generate a collision polygon from a sprite, select the ``Sprite2D`` node, go to the **Sprite2D** menu that appears above the viewport, and choose **Create Polygon2D Sibling**.
/// 
/// **Performance:** ``ConvexPolygonShape2D`` is faster to check collisions against compared to ``ConcavePolygonShape2D``, but it is slower than primitive collision shapes such as ``CircleShape2D`` and ``RectangleShape2D``. Its use should generally be limited to medium-sized objects that cannot have their collision accurately represented by primitive shapes.
