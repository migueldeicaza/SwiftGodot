/// Base class for all other classes in the engine.
/// 
/// An advanced ``Variant`` type. All classes in the engine inherit from Object. Each class may define new properties, methods or signals, which are available to all inheriting classes. For example, a ``Sprite2D`` instance is able to call ``Node/addChild(node:forceReadableName:`internal`:)`` because it inherits from ``Node``.
/// 
/// You can create new instances, using `Object.new()` in GDScript, or `new GodotObject` in C#.
/// 
/// To delete an Object instance, call ``free()``. This is necessary for most classes inheriting Object, because they do not manage memory on their own, and will otherwise cause memory leaks when no longer in use. There are a few classes that perform memory management. For example, ``RefCounted`` (and by extension ``Resource``) deletes itself when no longer referenced, and ``Node`` deletes its children when freed.
/// 
/// Objects can have a ``Script`` attached to them. Once the ``Script`` is instantiated, it effectively acts as an extension to the base class, allowing it to define and inherit new properties, methods and signals.
/// 
/// Inside a ``Script``, ``_getPropertyList()`` may be overridden to customize properties in several ways. This allows them to be available to the editor, display as lists of options, sub-divide into groups, save on disk, etc. Scripting languages offer easier ways to customize properties, such as with the [annotation @GDScript.@export] annotation.
/// 
/// Godot is very dynamic. An object's script, and therefore its properties, methods and signals, can be changed at run-time. Because of this, there can be occasions where, for example, a property required by a method may not exist. To prevent run-time errors, see methods such as ``set(property:value:)``, ``get(property:)``, ``call(method:)``, ``hasMethod(_:)``, ``hasSignal(_:)``, etc. Note that these methods are **much** slower than direct references.
/// 
/// In GDScript, you can also check if a given property, method, or signal name exists in an object with the `in` operator:
/// 
/// Notifications are integer constants commonly sent and received by objects. For example, on every rendered frame, the ``SceneTree`` notifies nodes inside the tree with a ``Node/notificationProcess``. The nodes receive it and may call ``Node/_process(delta:)`` to update. To make use of notifications, see ``notification(what:reversed:)`` and ``_notification()``.
/// 
/// Lastly, every object can also contain metadata (data about data). ``setMeta(name:value:)`` can be useful to store information that the object itself does not depend on. To keep your code clean, making excessive use of metadata is discouraged.
/// 
/// > Note: Unlike references to a ``RefCounted``, references to an object stored in a variable can become invalid without being set to `null`. To check if an object has been deleted, do _not_ compare it against `null`. Instead, use ``@GlobalScope.is_instance_valid``. It's also recommended to inherit from ``RefCounted`` for classes storing data instead of ``Object``.
/// 
/// > Note: The `script` is not exposed like most properties. To set or get an object's ``Script`` in code, use ``setScript(_:)`` and ``getScript()``, respectively.
/// 
/// 
/// 
/// This object emits the following signals:
/// 
/// - ``scriptChanged``
/// - ``propertyListChanged``

If the signal is already connected, this method returns ``GodotError/errInvalidParameter`` and pushes an error message, unless the signal is connected with ``ConnectFlags/referenceCounted``.

    /// 
    /// Connecting signals is one of the most common operations in Godot and the API gives many options to do so, which are described further down. The code block below shows the recommended approach.
    /// 
    /// **[code skip-lint]Object.connect()` or [code skip-lint]Signal.connect()`?**
    /// 
    /// As seen above, the recommended method to connect signals is not ``Object/connect(signal:callable:flags:)``. The code block below shows the four options for connecting signals, using either this legacy method or the recommended ``Signal/connect(callable:flags:)``, and using either an implicit ``Callable`` or a manually defined one.
    /// 
    /// While all options have the same outcome (`button`'s [signal BaseButton.button_down] signal will be connected to `_on_button_down`), **option 3** offers the best validation: it will print a compile-time error if either the `button_down` ``Signal`` or the `_on_button_down` ``Callable`` are not defined. On the other hand, **option 2** only relies on string names and will only be able to validate either names at runtime: it will print a runtime error if `"button_down"` doesn't correspond to a signal, or if `"_on_button_down"` is not a registered method in the object `self`. The main reason for using options 1, 2, or 4 would be if you actually need to use strings (e.g. to connect signals programmatically based on strings read from a configuration file). Otherwise, option 3 is the recommended (and fastest) method.
    /// 
    /// **Binding and passing parameters:**
    /// 
    /// The syntax to bind parameters is through ``Callable/bind()``, which returns a copy of the ``Callable`` with its parameters bound.
