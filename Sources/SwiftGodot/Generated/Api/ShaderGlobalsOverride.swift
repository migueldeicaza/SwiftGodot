/// A node used to override global shader parameters' values in a scene.
/// 
/// Similar to how a ``WorldEnvironment`` node can be used to override the environment while a specific scene is loaded, ``ShaderGlobalsOverride`` can be used to override global shader parameters temporarily. Once the node is removed, the project-wide values for the global shader parameters are restored. See the ``RenderingServer`` `global_shader_parameter_*` methods for more information.
/// 
/// > Note: Only one ``ShaderGlobalsOverride`` can be used per scene. If there is more than one ``ShaderGlobalsOverride`` node in the scene tree, only the first node (in tree order) will be taken into account.
/// 
/// > Note: All ``ShaderGlobalsOverride`` nodes are made part of a `"shader_overrides_group"` group when they are added to the scene tree. The currently active ``ShaderGlobalsOverride`` node also has a `"shader_overrides_group_active"` group added to it. You can use this to check which ``ShaderGlobalsOverride`` node is currently active.
