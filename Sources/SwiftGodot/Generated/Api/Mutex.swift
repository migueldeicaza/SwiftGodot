/// A binary ``Semaphore`` for synchronization of multiple ``Thread``s.
/// 
/// A synchronization mutex (mutual exclusion). This is used to synchronize multiple ``Thread``s, and is equivalent to a binary ``Semaphore``. It guarantees that only one thread can access a critical section at a time.
/// 
/// This is a reentrant mutex, meaning that it can be locked multiple times by one thread, provided it also unlocks it as many times.
/// 
/// > Warning: Mutexes must be used carefully to avoid deadlocks.
/// 
/// > Warning: To ensure proper cleanup without crashes or deadlocks, the following conditions must be met:
/// 
/// - When a ``Mutex``'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, no threads (including the one on which the destruction will happen) must have it locked.
/// 
/// - When a ``Thread``'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, it must not have any mutex locked.
