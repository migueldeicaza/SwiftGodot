/// Placeholder for the root ``Node`` of a ``PackedScene``.
/// 
/// Turning on the option **Load As Placeholder** for an instantiated scene in the editor causes it to be replaced by an ``InstancePlaceholder`` when running the game, this will not replace the node in the editor. This makes it possible to delay actually loading the scene until calling ``createInstance(replace:customScene:)``. This is useful to avoid loading large scenes all at once by loading parts of it selectively.
/// 
/// The ``InstancePlaceholder`` does not have a transform. This causes any child nodes to be positioned relatively to the ``Viewport`` from point (0,0), rather than their parent as displayed in the editor. Replacing the placeholder with a scene with a transform will transform children relatively to their parent again.
