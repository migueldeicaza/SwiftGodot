/// Omnidirectional light, such as a light bulb or a candle.
/// 
/// An Omnidirectional light is a type of ``Light3D`` that emits light in all directions. The light is attenuated by distance and this attenuation can be configured by changing its energy, radius, and attenuation parameters.
/// 
/// > Note: When using the Mobile rendering method, only 8 omni lights can be displayed on each mesh resource. Attempting to display more than 8 omni lights on a single mesh resource will result in omni lights flickering in and out as the camera moves. When using the Compatibility rendering method, only 8 omni lights can be displayed on each mesh resource by default, but this can be increased by adjusting ``ProjectSettings/rendering/limits/opengl/maxLightsPerObject``.
/// 
/// > Note: When using the Mobile or Compatibility rendering methods, omni lights will only correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the light's AABB. If using a shader to deform the mesh in a way that makes it go outside its AABB, ``GeometryInstance3D/extraCullMargin`` must be increased on the mesh. Otherwise, the light may not be visible on the mesh.
