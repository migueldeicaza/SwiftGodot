/// A 2D physics body specialized for characters moved by script.
/// 
/// ``CharacterBody2D`` is a specialized class for physics bodies that are meant to be user-controlled. They are not affected by physics at all, but they affect other physics bodies in their path. They are mainly used to provide high-level API to move objects with wall and slope detection (``moveAndSlide()`` method) in addition to the general collision detection provided by ``PhysicsBody2D/moveAndCollide(motion:testOnly:safeMargin:recoveryAsCollision:)``. This makes it useful for highly configurable physics bodies that must move in specific ways and collide with the world, as is often the case with user-controlled characters.
/// 
/// For game objects that don't require complex movement or collision detection, such as moving platforms, ``AnimatableBody2D`` is simpler to configure.
