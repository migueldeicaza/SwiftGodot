/// Interface to a WebRTC peer connection.
/// 
/// A WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. Provides an interface to connect, maintain and monitor the connection.
/// 
/// Setting up a WebRTC connection between two peers may not seem a trivial task, but it can be broken down into 3 main steps:
/// 
/// - The peer that wants to initiate the connection (`A` from now on) creates an offer and send it to the other peer (`B` from now on).
/// 
/// - `B` receives the offer, generate and answer, and sends it to `A`).
/// 
/// - `A` and `B` then generates and exchange ICE candidates with each other.
/// 
/// After these steps, the connection should become connected. Keep on reading or look into the tutorial for more information.
/// 
/// 
/// 
/// This object emits the following signals:
/// 
/// - ``sessionDescriptionCreated``
/// - ``iceCandidateCreated``
/// - ``dataChannelReceived``
