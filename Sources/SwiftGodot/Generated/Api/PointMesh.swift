/// Mesh with a single Point primitive.
/// 
/// The PointMesh is made from a single point. Instead of relying on triangles, points are rendered as a single rectangle on the screen with a constant size. They are intended to be used with Particle systems, but can be used as a cheap way to render constant size billboarded sprites (for example in a point cloud).
/// 
/// PointMeshes, must be used with a material that has a point size. Point size can be accessed in a shader with `POINT_SIZE`, or in a ``BaseMaterial3D`` by setting ``BaseMaterial3D/usePointSize`` and the variable ``BaseMaterial3D/pointSize``.
/// 
/// When using PointMeshes, properties that normally alter vertices will be ignored, including billboard mode, grow, and cull face.
