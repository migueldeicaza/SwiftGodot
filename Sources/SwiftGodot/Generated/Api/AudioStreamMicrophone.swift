/// When used directly in an ``AudioStreamPlayer`` node, ``AudioStreamMicrophone`` plays back microphone input in real-time. This can be used in conjunction with ``AudioEffectCapture`` to process the data or save it.
/// 
/// > Note: ``ProjectSettings/audio/driver/enableInput`` must be `true` for audio input to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to permissions and operating system privacy settings.
