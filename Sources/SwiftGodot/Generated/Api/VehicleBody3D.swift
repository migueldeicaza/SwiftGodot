/// A 3D physics body that simulates the behavior of a car.
/// 
/// This physics body implements all the physics logic needed to simulate a car. It is based on the raycast vehicle system commonly found in physics engines. Aside from a ``CollisionShape3D`` for the main body of the vehicle, you must also add a ``VehicleWheel3D`` node for each wheel. You should also add a ``MeshInstance3D`` to this node for the 3D model of the vehicle, but this model should generally not include meshes for the wheels. You can control the vehicle by using the ``brake``, ``engineForce``, and ``steering`` properties. The position or orientation of this node shouldn't be changed directly.
/// 
/// > Note: The origin point of your VehicleBody3D will determine the center of gravity of your vehicle. To make the vehicle more grounded, the origin point is usually kept low, moving the ``CollisionShape3D`` and ``MeshInstance3D`` upwards.
/// 
/// > Note: This class has known issues and isn't designed to provide realistic 3D vehicle physics. If you want advanced vehicle physics, you may have to write your own physics integration using ``CharacterBody3D`` or ``RigidBody3D``.
