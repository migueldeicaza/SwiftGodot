/// A ``Cubemap`` without image data.
/// 
/// This class replaces a ``Cubemap`` or a ``Cubemap``-derived class in 2 conditions:
/// 
/// - In dedicated server mode, where the image data shouldn't affect game logic. This allows reducing the exported PCK's size significantly.
/// 
/// - When the ``Cubemap``-derived class is missing, for example when using a different engine version.
/// 
/// > Note: This class is not intended for rendering or for use in shaders. Operations like calculating UV are not guaranteed to work.
