/// A control used to edit properties of an object.
/// 
/// This is the control that implements property editing in the editor's Settings dialogs, the Inspector dock, etc. To get the ``EditorInspector`` used in the editor's Inspector dock, use ``EditorInterface/getInspector()``.
/// 
/// ``EditorInspector`` will show properties in the same order as the array returned by ``Object/getPropertyList()``.
/// 
/// If a property's name is path-like (i.e. if it contains forward slashes), ``EditorInspector`` will create nested sections for "directories" along the path. For example, if a property is named `highlighting/gdscript/node_path_color`, it will be shown as "Node Path Color" inside the "GDScript" section nested inside the "Highlighting" section.
/// 
/// If a property has ``PropertyUsageFlags/propertyUsageGroup`` usage, it will group subsequent properties whose name starts with the property's hint string. The group ends when a property does not start with that hint string or when a new group starts. An empty group name effectively ends the current group. ``EditorInspector`` will create a top-level section for each group. For example, if a property with group usage is named `Collide With` and its hint string is `collide_with_`, a subsequent `collide_with_area` property will be shown as "Area" inside the "Collide With" section. There is also a special case: when the hint string contains the name of a property, that property is grouped too. This is mainly to help grouping properties like `font`, `font_color` and `font_size` (using the hint string `font_`).
/// 
/// If a property has ``PropertyUsageFlags/propertyUsageSubgroup`` usage, a subgroup will be created in the same way as a group, and a second-level section will be created for each subgroup.
/// 
/// > Note: Unlike sections created from path-like property names, ``EditorInspector`` won't capitalize the name for sections created from groups. So properties with group usage usually use capitalized names instead of snake_cased names.
