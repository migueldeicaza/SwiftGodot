/// Computes and stores baked lightmaps for fast global illumination.
/// 
/// The ``LightmapGI`` node is used to compute and store baked lightmaps. Lightmaps are used to provide high-quality indirect lighting with very little light leaking. ``LightmapGI`` can also provide rough reflections using spherical harmonics if ``directional`` is enabled. Dynamic objects can receive indirect lighting thanks to _light probes_, which can be automatically placed by setting ``generateProbesSubdiv`` to a value other than ``GenerateProbes/disabled``. Additional lightmap probes can also be added by creating ``LightmapProbe`` nodes. The downside is that lightmaps are fully static and cannot be baked in an exported project. Baking a ``LightmapGI`` node is also slower compared to ``VoxelGI``.
/// 
/// **Procedural generation:** Lightmap baking functionality is only available in the editor. This means ``LightmapGI`` is not suited to procedurally generated or user-built levels. For procedurally generated or user-built levels, use ``VoxelGI`` or SDFGI instead (see ``Environment/sdfgiEnabled``).
/// 
/// **Performance:** ``LightmapGI`` provides the best possible run-time performance for global illumination. It is suitable for low-end hardware including integrated graphics and mobile devices.
/// 
/// > Note: Due to how lightmaps work, most properties only have a visible effect once lightmaps are baked again.
/// 
/// > Note: Lightmap baking on ``CSGShape3D``s and ``PrimitiveMesh``es is not supported, as these cannot store UV2 data required for baking.
/// 
/// > Note: If no custom lightmappers are installed, ``LightmapGI`` can only be baked from devices that support the Forward+ or Mobile rendering backends.
