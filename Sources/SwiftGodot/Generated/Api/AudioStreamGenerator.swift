/// An audio stream with utilities for procedural sound generation.
/// 
/// ``AudioStreamGenerator`` is a type of audio stream that does not play back sounds on its own; instead, it expects a script to generate audio data for it. See also ``AudioStreamGeneratorPlayback``.
/// 
/// Here's a sample on how to use it to generate a sine wave:
/// 
/// In the example above, the "AudioStreamPlayer" node must use an ``AudioStreamGenerator`` as its stream. The `fill_buffer` function provides audio data for approximating a sine wave.
/// 
/// See also ``AudioEffectSpectrumAnalyzer`` for performing real-time audio spectrum analysis.
/// 
/// > Note: Due to performance constraints, this class is best used from C# or from a compiled language via GDExtension. If you still want to use this class from GDScript, consider using a lower ``mixRate`` such as 11,025 Hz or 22,050 Hz.

    /// The sample rate to use (in Hz). Higher values are more demanding for the CPU to generate, but result in better quality.
    /// 
    /// In games, common sample rates in use are `11025`, `16000`, `22050`, `32000`, `44100`, and `48000`.
    /// 
    /// According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem</a>, there is no quality difference to human hearing when going past 40,000 Hz (since most humans can only hear up to ~20,000 Hz, often less). If you are generating lower-pitched sounds such as voices, lower sample rates such as `32000` or `22050` may be usable with no loss in quality.
