/// Six square textures representing the faces of a cube. Commonly used as a skybox.
/// 
/// A cubemap is made of 6 textures organized in layers. They are typically used for faking reflections in 3D rendering (see ``ReflectionProbe``). It can be used to make an object look as if it's reflecting its surroundings. This usually delivers much better performance than other reflection methods.
/// 
/// This resource is typically used as a uniform in custom shaders. Few core Godot methods make use of ``Cubemap`` resources.
/// 
/// To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the Godot Editor import presets.
/// 
/// > Note: Godot doesn't support using cubemaps in a ``PanoramaSkyMaterial``. You can use <a href="https://danilw.github.io/GLSL-howto/cubemap_to_panorama_js/cubemap_to_panorama.html">this tool</a> to convert a cubemap to an equirectangular sky map.
