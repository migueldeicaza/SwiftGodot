/// Abstract base class for everything in 2D space. Canvas items are laid out in a tree; children inherit and extend their parent's transform. ``CanvasItem`` is extended by ``Control`` for GUI-related nodes, and by ``Node2D`` for 2D game objects.
/// 
/// Any ``CanvasItem`` can draw. For this, ``queueRedraw()`` is called by the engine, then ``notificationDraw`` will be received on idle time to request a redraw. Because of this, canvas items don't need to be redrawn on every frame, improving the performance significantly. Several functions for drawing on the ``CanvasItem`` are provided (see `draw_*` functions). However, they can only be used inside ``_draw()``, its corresponding ``Wrapper._notification(code:reverse)`` or methods connected to the [signal draw] signal.
/// 
/// Canvas items are drawn in tree order on their canvas layer. By default, children are on top of their parents, so a root ``CanvasItem`` will be drawn behind everything. This behavior can be changed on a per-item basis.
/// 
/// A ``CanvasItem`` can be hidden, which will also hide its children. By adjusting various other properties of a ``CanvasItem``, you can also modulate its color (via ``modulate`` or ``selfModulate``), change its Z-index, blend mode, and more.
/// 
/// Note that properties like transform, modulation, and visibility are only propagated to _direct_ ``CanvasItem`` child nodes. If there is a non-``CanvasItem`` node in between, like ``Node`` or ``AnimationPlayer``, the ``CanvasItem`` nodes below will have an independent position and ``modulate`` chain. See also ``topLevel``.
///

/// This object emits the following signals:
///

/// - ``visibilityChanged``
/// - ``hidden``
