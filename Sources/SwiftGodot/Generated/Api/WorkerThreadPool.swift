/// A singleton that allocates some ``Thread``s on startup, used to offload tasks to these threads.
/// 
/// The ``WorkerThreadPool`` singleton allocates a set of ``Thread``s (called worker threads) on project startup and provides methods for offloading tasks to them. This can be used for simple multithreading without having to create ``Thread``s.
/// 
/// Tasks hold the ``Callable`` to be run by the threads. ``WorkerThreadPool`` can be used to create regular tasks, which will be taken by one worker thread, or group tasks, which can be distributed between multiple worker threads. Group tasks execute the ``Callable`` multiple times, which makes them useful for iterating over a lot of elements, such as the enemies in an arena.
/// 
/// Here's a sample on how to offload an expensive function to worker threads:
/// 
/// The above code relies on the number of elements in the `enemies` array remaining constant during the multithreaded part.
/// 
/// > Note: Using this singleton could affect performance negatively if the task being distributed between threads is not computationally expensive.
