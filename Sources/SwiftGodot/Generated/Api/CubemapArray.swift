/// An array of ``Cubemap``s, stored together and with a single reference.
/// 
/// ``CubemapArray``s are made of an array of ``Cubemap``s. Like ``Cubemap``s, they are made of multiple textures, the amount of which must be divisible by 6 (one for each face of the cube).
/// 
/// The primary benefit of ``CubemapArray``s is that they can be accessed in shader code using a single texture reference. In other words, you can pass multiple ``Cubemap``s into a shader using a single ``CubemapArray``. ``Cubemap``s are allocated in adjacent cache regions on the GPU, which makes ``CubemapArray``s the most efficient way to store multiple ``Cubemap``s.
/// 
/// > Note: Godot uses ``CubemapArray``s internally for many effects, including the ``Sky`` if you set ``ProjectSettings/rendering/reflections/skyReflections/textureArrayReflections`` to `true`. To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the import presets of the File System dock.
/// 
/// > Note: ``CubemapArray`` is not supported in the OpenGL 3 rendering backend.
