/// A 3×4 matrix representing a 3D transformation.
/// 
/// The ``Transform3D`` built-in ``Variant`` type is a 3×4 matrix representing a transformation in 3D space. It contains a ``Basis``, which on its own can represent rotation, scale, and shear. Additionally, combined with its own ``origin``, the transform can also represent a translation.
/// 
/// For a general introduction, see the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en//tutorials/math/matrices_and_transforms.html">Matrices and transforms</a> tutorial.
/// 
/// > Note: Godot uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule">right-handed coordinate system</a>, which is a common standard. For directions, the convention for built-in types like ``Camera3D`` is for -Z to point forward (+X is right, +Y is up, and +Z is back). Other objects may use different direction conventions. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en//tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_scenes.html#d-asset-direction-conventions">Importing 3D Scenes</a> tutorial.
