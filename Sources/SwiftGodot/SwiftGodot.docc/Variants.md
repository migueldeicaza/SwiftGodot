# Variants

Follow up on the fundamental building block of Godot's data types.

## Overview

You will often find the type ``Variant`` in Godot source code.   Variants are
Godot's way of passing around certain data types.  They are similar to Swift's
`Any` type, but they can only hold Godot types (most structures and classes
that derive from ``Object``). 

## Creating Variant values

You can create Variants from types that conform to the VariantStorable 
protocol. 

This includes the following types:

* Godot's native types: GString, Vector, Rect, Transform, Plane, Quaternion,
  AABB,  Basis, Projection, Int64, NodePaths, RIDs, Callable, GDictionary, Array
  and PackedArrays. 
* Swift types that SwiftGodot adds convenience conformances for: Bool, Int, String and Float
* Godot's objects: e.g. Node, Area2D
* Your own subclasses of SwiftGodot.Object type.
* Other types that you can manually conform to VariantStorable.

You wrap your data type by calling one of the ``Variant`` constructors, and then
you can pass this variant to Godot functions that expect a ``Variant``.

For example, to pass the value `true`:

```swift
let trueVaraint = Variant (true)
```

You can get a string representation of a variant by calling ``Variant``'s
``Variant/description`` method:

```swift
print (trueVariant.description)
```

If you have a ``Variant`` and want to extract its value, you typically use this
pattern:

```swift
/// This method will return nil if the Variant provided does not contain
/// a boolean value.   Otherwise it will contain the boolean stored in the
/// variant.
func getBoolValue (variant: Variant) -> Bool? {
    guard let boolValue = Bool (variant) else {
        return nil
    }
    return boolValue
}
```

SwiftGodot provides convenience [failable
initializers](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=17) for all the types
that can be stored in a Variant.  If the variant does not contain the type you
are requesting the result of the call is `nil`.


## Common Usage Patterns

The following are some examples of how to work with Variants in practice, and
some idioms suitable to be used with Swift.

In the following example, imagine that an API returns a Variant value that
contains a dictionary with string keys and values are ``PackedArrayInt32``, this
is how you would decode this:

```swift
/// This converts a variant that contains a dictionary of string keys and an 
/// array of integers into the native Swift dictionary
func decode (variant: Variant) -> [String: [Int32]]? {
    guard let dict = GDictionary (variant) else {
        // If the variant is not a dictionary, we return nil
        return nil
    }
    var result = [String: [Int32]] ()
    for (key, value) in dict {
        guard let packedArray = PackedArrayInt32 (value) else {
            // If the `value` in the dictionary is not of type `PackedArrayInt32`, we ski it
            continue
        }
        result [key] = packedArray
    }
    return result
}
```

The above shows a defensive style of programming, where we prepare for the 
possibility that we do not receive a dictionary, or the values in the dictionary
are not of type ``PackedArrayInt32``.

The following examples shows how to encode an array that contains
paris of file names and sizes into a Godot ``GArray`` with
``GDictionary`` elements:

```swift
func encode(values: [(String,Int)]) -> Variant {
    let array = GArray ()
    for (fileName, size) in values {
        let dict = GDictionary ()
        dict ["file_name"] = Variant (fileName)
        dict ["size"] = Variant (size)
        array.append (dict)
    }
    return Variant (array)
}
```


The next example shows how to decode the result of the above.  The ``GArray``
and ``GDictionary`` are weakly typed, so the inverse operation takes a defensive
approach.

```swift
func decode(variant: Variant) -> [(String, Int)]? {
    guard let array = Array (variant) else {
        // If the variant is not an array, we return nil
        return nil
    }
    var result = [(String, Int)] ()
    for element in array {
        guard let dict = GDictionary (element) else {
            // If the element in the array is not a dictionary, we skip it
            continue
        }
        guard let fileNameV = dict ["file_name"], 
              let fileName = String (filenameV) else {
            // If the dictionary does not contain a string with the 
            // key "file_name", we skip it
            continue
        }
        guard let sizeV = dict ["size"],
              let size = Int (sizeV) else {
            // If the dictionary does not contain an integer with the key 
            // "size", or if the value can not be converted to an Int,
            // we skip it
            continue
        }
        result.append ((fileName, size))
    }
    return result
}
```

## Extracting values from Variants

If you know the kind of return that a variant will return, you can invoke the
failing initializer for that specific type for most structures. Every VariantStorable
will have an `init(_ variant: Variant)` implementation.

For example, this is how you could get a Vector2 from a variant:

```swift
func distance (variant: Variant) -> Float? {
    guard let vector = Vector2 (variant) else {
	return nil
    }
    return vector.length ()
}
```

Notice that this might return `nil`, which would be the case if the variant
contains a different type than the one you were expecting. You can check the
type of the variant by accessing the `.gtype` property of the variant.

## Extracting Godot-derived objects from Variants

Godot-derived objects are slightly different. If you know you have a
``Object`` stored in the variant, you can call the ``Variant/asObject(_:)``
instead.  This is a generic method, so you would invoke it like this:

```swift
func getNode (variant: Variant) -> Node? {
    guard let node = variant.asObject (Node.self)) else {
	  return nil
    }
    return node
}
```

Swift type inference can also be used, so you can avoid specifying the type if
the compiler can infer the type, like here:

```swift
func getNode (variant: Variant) -> Node? {
    var node: Node?
    node = variant.asObject ()
    return node
}
```

The reason to rely on calling the `asObject` method rather than having a
constructor for the type that takes a variant (like the case for the non-object
types) is that the method can ensure that only one instance of your objects is surfaced to Swift. 

## Accessing Array Elements

Some of the variant types contain arrays, either objects, or a particular
packed version of those.   You can access the individual elements of the
those with a convenient subscript provided on the array.

## Calling Variant Methods

It is possible to invoke the built-in variant methods that exist in the Godot
universe by using the `call` method on a Variant.   This is very similar to the
call method on an Object.

For example, you can invoke this generic "size" method on an array to get the
size of an array, regardless of the specific type of array:

```
func printSize (myArray: Variant) {
    switch variant.call(method: "size") {
    case .failure(let err):
        print (err)
        return 0
    case .success(let val):
        return Int (val) ?? 0
    }
}
```
