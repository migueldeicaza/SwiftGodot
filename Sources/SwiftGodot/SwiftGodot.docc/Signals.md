# Signals

Signals in Godot are used by objects to post interesting events that are
taking place, and can be used by users to easily add behavior and react
to changes.

## Overview

Objects in Godot can emit signals, these are notification about certain
events taking place in the objects that can be observed externally.  

In SwiftGodot, there is a convenient interface to connect to a signal, as well
as a low-level framework to manually connect to signals and a mechanism to 
define your own signals.

Objects that emit signals typically do so by using the ``Object/emit(signal:)`` 
method (or the lower-level ``Object/emitSignal(signal:_:)``
function) which takes as a parameter the ``StringName`` of the signal as well
as an optional list of additional arguments.   And users can connect to those
signals and direct a method to be invoked when they are raised.

## Using Signals

To connect to a signal, find the signal that you want to connect to in your
type, and then call the connect method on it.

For example, to connect to the ``Node/ready`` signal, you call its connect
method, like this:

```
func setupBot (robot: Node) {
    robot.ready.connect {
        print ("The robot's node is ready")
    }
}
```

Since signals in Godot can include parameters, each signal in Godot 
surfaces a connect method that takes as an argument a function with the
precise signature that it will be invoked with.


If you want to stop receiving notifications, you can disconnect from the
object, to do so, you must keep around the token returned by the connect
method, like this:

```swift
class Demo: Node {
    var readyToken: Object

    func setup () {
        readyToken = robot.ready.connect {
            print ("Ready")
        }
    }

    func teardown () {
        robot.ready.disconnect (readyToken)
    }
}
```

## One-shot signals

One common idiom in Godot code is to wait for a signal to be raised before 
continuing execution.   For example, you might want to wait for a timeout
or an action.

In those cases, you can await the `emitted` property of the generated
signal, like this:

```swift
func waitTimer (scene: SceneTree) async {
    // Creates the timer
    let timer = scene.createTimer (timeSec: 3)

    // Wait until the timer fires
    await timer.timeout.emitted

    print ("Done waiting!")
}
```

If you do not have an async function, you can await your signal with
the following idiom:

```swift
func waitSomething (scene: SceneTree) {
    // Creates a task, but executes on the main actor
    Task { @MainActor in
        await timer.timeout.emitted
        print ("happy on the main thread")
    }    
}
```

## Declaring your own Signals

It is also possible to define your own signals to broadcast them, both
to other Swift component as well as using them in Godot or from the 
Godot Scripting language.

Signals belong to your class, so you need to declare those once per class,
and then every instance of your class can emit them.

Signals can have zero or more parameters, and you will need to declare
the parameters that your signal consumes, any potential return values (these
are quite unusual, but the API supports it), and the name of your signal.

### Signals with no parameters

The following example shows how to declare a a signal named `burp` that
is emitted by your code:

```
@Godot
class Demo: Node3D {
    #signal("burp")

    // Convenience method to emit the signal
    public func emitBurp () {
        emit(Demo.burp)
    }
}
```

The free-standing macro `#signal` declares a signal named burp.   This macro
will turn signals using the snake-case naming convention into camel-case
names accessible in Swift.

So for example if you were to declare a signal called 'lives_changed' it
would be exposed to Godot as 'lives_changed', and to your Swift code as
'livesChanged'.

### Signals with parameters

Signals can carry additional information when they are emitted, and
you can pass any type that can be encoded as a Godot Variant to them
(this includes Swift core types like integers, doubles, strings, but
also Godot objects and the Godot core types;   See the documentation
for ``Variant`` for more information).

To use signals with parameters, you need to declare the parameter
types using the `arguments:` parameter, specifying the Swift type
of each parameter.


In the following example we create a signal exposed to godot called
`lives_changed` that takes an integer value, and it is surfaced to Swift as 
the signal 'livesChanged'.

The example below also shows how to emit the signal with the additional
integer payload:

```swift
@Godot 
class Player: Node2D {
    #signal("lives_changed", argument: ["new_lives_count": Int.self])

    func startGame() {
       emit(Player.livesChanged, 5)
    }
}
```

## Connecting Everything Together

This example shows how you can create a signal and connect to it:

```swift
@Godot 
class Player: Node2D {
    #signal("game_started")
    #signal("lives_changed", argument: ["new_lives_count": Int.self])

    func startGame() {
        // No arguments
        emit(Player.gameStarted)

        // One argument of type int
        emit(Player.livesChanged, 5)
    }
}

class Level: Area2D {
    func _ready() { 
       player.connect(Player.gameStarted, to: self, method: "game_started")
       player.connect(Player.livesChanged, to: self, method: "myLivesChanged")
    }

    @Callable func myLivesChanged (newLivesCount: Int) {
        print ("New lives: \(newLivesCount)")
    }

    @Callable func game_started() { 
       GD.print("got game started signal!")
    }
}
```

## Low-Level Signal API

This section is here for explanation purposes, but you should not need
to use this in your Godot code with Swift.

### Using the low-level Signal framework

While SwiftGodot provides a convenient way of connecting to objects,
if you need to connect to objects that are not included in the binding
or you want to implement additional semantics, you can always use the
low-level API for connecting signals.

To connect a signal directly, you use the ``Object/connect(signal:callable:flags:)``
method.   The first parameter is the ``StringName`` describing the signal
and the second one is refenrece to the method to invoke.  The ``Callable``
is a pair of the object instance and the ``StringName`` of the method to invoke.

For example:

```
let callable = Callable(object: self, method: StringName ("MyCallback"))
object.connect(signal: "some_signal", callable)
```

This would call a method registered with Godot under the name `MyCallback`
on the provided instance when the `object` raises the `some_signal`.

To surface a Swift method to Godot, and thus be able to reference it with 
a StringName, you would use a similar method to register a signal:

```
func mySwiftCallback () {
   print ("MyCallback has been invoked!")
}

func setup () {
    classInfo.registerMethod(
        name: "MyCallback", 
        flags: .default, 
        returnValue: nil, 
        arguments: [], 
        function: Demo.mySwiftCallback)
}
```

### Emitting Signals

The ``Object/emit(signal:)`` family of methods is a high-level version
that provides some of the boilerplate information for you, and also
conveniently allows you to call the emit method with any type that implements
the ``VariantStorable`` protocol.   

It is quite convenient to use as you do not need to wrap your parameters in 
``Variants`` nor provide the ``PropInfo`` elements for your signal definition.

When you declare signals using the #signal macro, you can trivially use this path.

Sometimes you might need to emit a signal on a foreign object, to pretend the
object triggered that signal.  I will not pass any judgement on this, I merely 
want to empower you to get the job done.

In those situations, you might still want to use the convenience emit method, over
the ``Object/emitSignal`` version.   But you will find that you can not just call the method
with the signal name as you did before.

In those cases, you will need to provide both the signal name, and the argument 
names, like this:

```swift
let foreign: Node

foreign.emit(signal: SignalWith1Argument("open", argument1Name: "path"), "/tmp/demo")
```

The `signal` parameter is not a plain ``StringName``, instead it takes one of the
SignalWithArgument types to specify the names of the arguments.
