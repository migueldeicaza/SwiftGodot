//  Created by Miguel de Icaza on 3/28/23.
//
// This is the base class for all types that Godot calls "Classes", as
// opposed to their "Built-ins".   The built-ins are a mix of structs and
// classes that have all of their payload inlined - and just differ on
// their moving semantics.
//
// The generated Godot classes can be subclassed by the user, and their
// state is preserved if the object is passed to Godot, and later it is
// resurfaced to the Swift universe.
//
// We recognize the difference between objects that are merely proxies to
// the Godot API, and act as bridges, but whose entire state resides in
// the Godot land, and we call those FrameworkTypes vs types that the user
// has subclassed and might have potentially added state that needs to be
// preserved.
//
// FrameworkTypes are recreated on demand if necessary from their handle
// as they are only a proxy for the Godot side of the code, there is no
// harm in creating different copies of it, and destroying them when they
// are no longer in use.   To support identity, we implement Equatable
// based on their handles.
//
// Subclassed types are those that the user might have created, and could
// potentially keep state, so we need to keep those objects alive until
// they are destroyed, and when the framework surfaces objects of this
// type, we need to find and locate the existing live object, rather than
// returning a new instance
//
// We ensure that all Godot

/// The base class for all class bindings in Godot, you should not have

/// Wrapped implements Equatable based on an identity based on the
/// pointer to the Godot native object and also implements the Identifiable
/// protocol using this pointer.
///
/// Wrapped subclasses come in two forms: straight bindings to the Godot
/// API which are used to expose capabilities to developers.   These objects, referred
/// to as Framework types do not have any additional state associated in
/// Swift, so they can be discarded or recreated as many times as it is needed.
///
/// When user subclass Wrapped, they might have state associated with them,
/// so those objects are preserved and are not thrown away until they are
/// explicitly relinquished by both Godot and any references you might hold to
/// them.   These are known as User types.
///
/// Any subclass ends up calling the Wrapped(StringName) constructor which
/// provides the name of the most-derived framework type, and this constructor
/// determines whether this is a Framework type or a user type.
///
/// To register User types with the framework make sure you call the
/// `register<T:Wrapped> (type: T.Type)` method like this:
///
/// `register (type: MySpinningCube.self)`
